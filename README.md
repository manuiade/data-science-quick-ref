# Data Science Quick Reference

As title says, this is a small jupyter notebook gathering some common operations performed during EDA and machine learning algorithms evaluation.

**This isn't obviously an exhausitve reference guide, just some common operations I have gathered during my data science experiments**

## Exploring the notebook

Just install libraries specified in requirements.txt in a conda or pip virtual environment and explore the notebook.
